# Back-Up Service

This guide outlines how to set up and run a backup service using Docker and Kubernetes, which automatically syncs your designated local folder to Google Drive.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Kubernetes cluster (optional, if scaling is required).
- Google Cloud account to access Google Drive API.

## Step 1: Google Drive API Credentials

1. Obtain `credentials.json` for the Google Drive API from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Download the credentials file and save it to your project directory.

For assistance, refer to this YouTube tutorial: [Setting Up Google Drive API](https://youtu.be/G_4KUbuwtlM?si=U29qsiWeuLTLFhai)

## Step 2: Configure Docker

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to specify the path to your local directory that you want to back up:

```yaml
services:
  back-up-service:
    image: back-up-service:latest
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/directory:/usr/src/app/files
```


### Step 3: Authorization

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client python-dotenv
```

Run the `get_token.py` script to get authorized with Google.
```bash
python get_token.py
```

### Step 4: Create Google Drive Folder

- Create a folder in your Google Drive to store the backups.
- Run the `get_folder_id.py`, enter your folder name to get the folder ID, and it will generate `.env` file with the folder ID.
```bash
python get_folder_id.py
```

### Step 5: Build Docker Image

Execute the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t back-up-service:latest .
```

### Step 6: Launch the Service

Start the service using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```


### Step 7: Modify the Local Folder

Make changes (add or delete files) in the local backup directory specified in Step 2. These changes will be synchronized to your Google Drive folder.
